Setup of the study package
===========================================================================================

The following steps will detail how to set up the ScyllaCharacterization package using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) and how to execute the study.

# Package Installation

This section will detail the process for installing the ScyllaCharacterization package along with all of the R package dependencies using [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). In short, we are using renv to encapsulate the R dependencies for this project in a way that will not disturb your other R depdencies.

The script below is an example to use for setting up your environment. There are some items to consider before moving ahead with the installation.

## Package setup considerations

- We will use `renv` to install the R package dependencies. You should refer to the [renv cache](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#cache) section to review how these files are stored for your operating system. If you need/want to change the default storage for your R packages, you will need to set the R `RENV_PATHS_ROOT` environment variable to different path.
- If you plan to run this package in an environment without Internet access, you should set the `RENV_PATHS_CACHE` to the `projectRootFolder` so that you can copy the contents of the `projectRootFolder` to the machine with access to your CDM to run the study. Additionally, you will want to make sure you download the `renv.lock` file from the computer with Internet access.

## Package setup steps

The setup script below is used to install the **ScyllaCharacterization** package. You will need to modify this setup script as follows:

- Set the `projectRootFolder` variable to the directory specific to your environment. In this example we are using `E:/ScyllaCharacterization`. This root folder will serve a few purposes:
    - It will hold the R depdencies in subfolders in this directory.
    - It should be used to hold the output of running the study package.
- If you need to change the default location where `renv` will install the R package dependencies, uncomment out the line: `Sys.setenv("RENV_PATHS_ROOT"="E:\renv")` and replace `"E:\renv"` with your directory of choice.
- If you plan to run the package in an environment where there is no Internet access, uncomment out the line: `Sys.setenv("RENV_PATHS_CACHE"=projectFolder)`. This will ensure that all of the R package dependencies are copied to the `projectRootFolder`.

Then execute the script as shown below:

````
#------------------------------------------------------------------
# INITIAL PROJECT SETUP ---------------------------------------
#------------------------------------------------------------------
# This initial setup will ensure that you have all required
# R packages installed for use with the ScyllaCharacterization
# package. If you are running this in an environment where 
# there is no access to the Internet please see the sections
# below marked "offline setup step".
#------------------------------------------------------------------
#------------------------------------------------------------------
install.packages("renv")

projectFolder <- "E:/ScyllaCharacterization"
setwd(projectFolder)

# Download the lock file:
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohdsi-studies/ScyllaCharacterization/master/renv.lock", "renv.lock")
#Sys.setenv("BINPREF"="E:/R/Rtools/mingw_$(WIN)/bin/")

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL: If you want to change where renv stores the 
# R packages you can specify the RENV_PATHS_ROOT. Please
# refer to https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#cache
# for more details
#------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sys.setenv("RENV_PATHS_ROOT"="E:\renv")

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# OFFLINE SETUP STEP: If you want to have the entire contents of
# the renv R packages local to your project so that you may copy
# it to another computer, please uncomment the line below and
# specify the RENV_PATHS_CACHE location which should be your project
# folder.
#------------------------------------------------------------------
#Sys.setenv("RENV_PATHS_CACHE"=projectFolder)

# Build the local library:
renv::init()

# When not in RStudio, you'll need to restart R now
library(ScyllaCharacterization)

# -------------------------------------------------------------
# END Initial Project Setup
# -------------------------------------------------------------
````

You will see the following message the first time you run `renv::init()`: 

````
> renv::init()

Welcome to renv!

It looks like this is your first time using renv. This is a one-time message,
briefly describing some of renv's functionality.

renv maintains a local cache of data on the filesystem, located at:

  - "E:/renv"

This path can be customized: please see the documentation in `?renv::paths`.

renv will also write to files within the active project folder, including:

  - A folder 'renv' in the project directory, and
  - A lockfile called 'renv.lock' in the project directory.

In particular, projects using renv will normally use a private, per-project
R library, in which new packages will be installed. This project library is
isolated from other R libraries on your system.

In addition, renv will update files within your project directory, including:

  - .gitignore
  - .Rbuildignore
  - .Rprofile

Please read the introduction vignette with `vignette("renv")` for more information.
You can also browse the package documentation online at https://rstudio.github.io/renv.
````

You can safely continue by pressing 'y' after this prompt since the renv.lock file is downloaded from the **ScyllaCharacterization** GitHub code repository. Once the installation is complete, you may need to restart R (if you are working outside of RStudio) and you should see this message:

````
Project 'E:/ScyllaCharacterization' loaded. [renv 0.11.0]
````

Now the study package is installed and ready to execute! See the [study execution guide](STUDY-EXECUTION.md) for steps to run the package.
